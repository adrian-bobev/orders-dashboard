  You are an AI that analyzes stories and extracts information.

user_prompt: |
  You will receive a JSON object representing a story, with one or more text fields containing the story content. Your task is to identify:

  1. Characters: any named person or being mentioned more than once.
  2. Objects: any distinct object, item, or thing mentioned more than once.

  Return the results in a JSON object with this structure:
  {
    "characters": ["Character Name 1", "Character Name 2",..."Object Name 1", "Object Name 2", ...],
  }

  Rules:
  - Only include names or objects that appear **more than once**.
  - Ignore very generic words (like 'tree', 'house' unless clearly a key object).
  - Keep names and objects exactly as they appear in the text.

  Here is the story JSON:
  {YOUR_JSON_HERE}
